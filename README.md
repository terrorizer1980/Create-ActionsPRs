Use this stack to create a repository containing a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) 
web application that's deployed to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Why should you use this stack?
You can use this stack to create a preconfigured repository, complete with
a starter Next.js web application, and a live deployment, in just a few 
minutes.

Next.js gives you a great developer experience with all the features you need 
for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart 
bundling, route pre-fetching and more. You can start coding straight away, and
view the deployed site without having to do any manual configuration. 

This stack also sets up the repository, ready for you to get to work. It:
- Creates a `main` branch
- Creates repository topics
- Sets some branch rules
- Creates GitHub Actions workflows to provide CI/CD automation
